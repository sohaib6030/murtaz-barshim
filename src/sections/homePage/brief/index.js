        <p className={"brief-paragraph"}>
           his father was an athlete and all his brothers
          practised sports regularly. As a child, his father used to take him to
          the local athletics club and he loved it. At around 11 years old,
          Mutaz started going to training by himself. Focusing on the high jump,
          Mutaz soon started to reach heights he never before thought possibleâ€¦
